## Overview
This package holds the [**`ros2_control` integration**](https://control.ros.org/humble/index.html) for the [**MyActuator RMD-X actuator series**](https://www.myactuator.com/rmd-x) in the form of a [hardware component](https://control.ros.org/master/doc/ros2_control/hardware_interface/doc/hardware_components_userdoc.html). The hardware interface is based on the [C++ driver that I have written for these actuators](https://github.com/2b-t/myactuator_rmd).

```
This package is a work in progress and is currently not functional!
Check back in a couple of days.
